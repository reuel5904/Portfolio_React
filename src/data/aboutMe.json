        "description": "Hey there! My name is Reuel Palanca and I'm a 24-year-old Frontend Software Engineer. I am passionate about Web Development, and I am always eager to learn more. One of the things I look forward to is taking on a new challenge and developing web applications. I have 2+ years of experience in professional web development, three Google certificates and have completed a variety of self-developed projects. When I'm not typing away at VSCode, my interests align with watching anime, playing video games or maintaining my CSS for subreddits on Reddit.",
